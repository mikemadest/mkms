    - title: "Real estate configurator"
    
      intro: | 
        The context of this project is to allow a customer to choose floor covering
        and many options to a flat he has purchased.<br />
        There is a backoffice part to manage properties, flat, their rooms and the products to go with it.
        The public part is a showcase of customisation,
        and after login in you have access to more customizations, comparing and online ordering.

             - meeting the deadlines with a very tight schedule, two weeks of development<br />
             - another teams had worked on a backoffice for managing datas, and we needed to make the existing code work,
             with the difference in the model.<br />
             - R&d for the new preview tool : using threejs, 
             the customizables surfaces were renderer in real time and layered with the pre-rendered scenes.

            - managing a team : BO developer, html/css coder, two 3d artists and a developer<br />
            - improving codebase, modularisation<br />
            - PHP developer<br />
            - R&d: creating a 360° tool using real time and pre-rendered scene (demo at the top).<br />
            This work includes making a shader to get the equirectangular projection of the real time part.
            There were a lot of work with the 3d team, from uvw mapping, to making textures,
            solving problems, improving performances and making 3dsmax scripts. <br />
            - new testing process leading to a way higher quality of the product and faster.<br />
            - designing a 360° editor and production tools<br />
            - documentation for all tools<br />
            - meeting deadlines and expected quality level.<br />
